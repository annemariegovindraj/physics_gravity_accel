The stone moves along a circular path, continuously changing direction. When the string breaks, the stone flies off along a straight line. That is because it continues in the same direction as it was moving at the instant the string broke (Newton's first law). So, to keep the stone in a circular path, a force is needed. This is the CENTRIPETAL FORCE
The motion of the moon around the earth is also due to a centripetal force, no string though! The 	GRAVITATIONAL FORCE attracts the moon to the earth (and the earth to the moon.)
Isaac Newton wondered if the force that made the apple fall was the same as the one keeping the moon in an orbit around the earth. He also used Kepler's laws of planetary motion to derive his UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION  .  F= #G x M x m/ R$2!#  where G = 6.67 x 10$-11! #N m$2! / kg$2!#  is the universal gravitational constant . M and m are the masses of the 2 objects . R is the distance between the 2 objects
This UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION  applies to all planets of the solar system
This UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION  applies to all galaxies of the universe
To calculate the force with which the Sun attracts the Earth, assume  . mass of the Sun : 2 x 10$30! kg . mass of the Earth : 6 x 10$24! kg . radius of Earth's orbit around the Sun : 15 x 10$10! m  .   F = #6.67x2x6x10$-11+30+24!/15x15x10$20!#  #N m$2! kg$2!/kg$2! m$2!# = 3.56 x 10$22! N
Let's apply this Universal Law of Gravitation to the Earth and to us . If we compare the Universal Law of Gravitation F = G # M m/ R$2!#  to Newton's second law of motion  F = m  a, we see that indeed  #G M/ R$2!# has the dimensions of an acceleration  #N m$2!/kg$2!# x  #kg/m$2!# =  #m/sec$2!# . This value is a constant for objects near the surface of the earth. We use: . G= universal gravitation constant : 6.67 x 10$-11! #Nm$2!/kg$2!# . M=mass of earth : 6.0 x 10$24! kg . R= radius of the earth : 6.37 X 10$6! m . acceleration = #6.67 x 6.0 x 10$-11+24/ 6.37x6.37 x 10$12!# x #Nm$2!/kg$2!# x # kg/m$2! # . We obtain : Acceleration = 9.81 #m/sec$2!#, which we call g
Your weight is the force with which the Earth attracts your mass. So, weight= m x g. It is expressed in Newtons (N). . What about your weight on the Moon? The Moon's mass is 80 times less (7.36 x 10$22! kg) than Earth's mass, the Moon's radius is less too(1.74 x 10$6! m). Your weight (the force of attraction on your mass) will be about 6 times less than on Earth. Your MASS is a CONSTANT . g%moon! = #6.7x7.36 x 10$-11+22!/1.74x1.74 x 10$12!# x #Nm$2!kg/kg$2!m$2! # = #1.63 m/sec$2! #. So, if you weigh 42 kg on the earth, you will weigh only 7 kg on the moon
In the next exercise we calculate the speed and distance travelled by a ball falling from a 115 m high building. It's a FREE FALL because no forces other than gravity are considered. We use the formulae : . v=u+at .  s=ut + #at$2!/2 # . where a = g = 9.81 m/sec² .  . Use the button to stop and restart the animation
In the previous exercise, when the ball is dropped, acceleration, speed and displacement have the same direction i.e. downwards. Now, instead of measuring from the top of the tower and downwards, we measure from the groundlevel and upwards. The ball starts at 115 m, and the displacement becomes smaller when the ball is falling down . The formula s= #at$2!/2 #  .  . becomes  s = h - #at$2!/2#
At what time will the ball touch the ground? With what speed?  . - measurements from groundlevel . - initial displacement : h = 115 m . - in the formula s= h - #a t$2!/2 # , we put : s=0.
we get t = \/ 2 h /g = \/23.45 sec =4.84 sec .  and v = g t = 47.5 m/sec
In this example, a ball is thrown up. We measure from groundlevel upwards. Acceleration g is always downward (so, negative). At first, velocity is positive and displacement increases. Because of the gravity, velocity decreases (v=u-gt). The ball slows down. At v=0, displacement stops increasing. We reach maximum height. Thereafter, velocity becomes negative. Displacement decreases
When does the ball reach its highest point? . v = u - g t  with initial speed u=5.6 m/sec. .  When v=0, t%max! = #u/g# .  . And what is the highest point reached? . Use t%max! in the formula s = s%0!+ut + #at$2!/2# with initial height=s%0! =1.5 m
